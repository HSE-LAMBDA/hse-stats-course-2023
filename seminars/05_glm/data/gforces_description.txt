Source: http://www.statsci.org/data/general/gforces.html

Keywords: binary data, binomial regression

## Description

Military pilots sometimes black out when their brains are deprived of oxygen due to G-forces during violent maneuvers. Glaister and Miller (1990) produced similar symptoms by exposing volunteersâ€™ lower bodies to negative air pressure, likewise decreasing oxygen to the brain. The data lists the subjects' ages and whether they showed syncopal blackout related signs (pallor, sweating, slow heartbeat, unconsciousness) during an 18 minute period.

    Variable        Description
    Subject     Initials of the subject's name
    Age     Subject's age in years
    Signs       Whether subject showed blackout-related signs (0=No, 1=Yes)

## Analysis

Regress binary response on one continuous covariate. Not statistically significant but easy to understand.
