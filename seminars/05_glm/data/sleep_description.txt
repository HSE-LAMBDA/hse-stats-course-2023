# Sleep in Mammals

Source: http://www.statsci.org/data/general/sleep.html

## Description

Includes brain and body weight, life span, gestation time, time sleeping, and predation and danger indices for 62 species of mammals. Of interest is to predict the time spent sleeping and the proportion of sleep time in dream sleep.

Variable        Description
BodyWt      body weight (kg)
BrainWt     brain weight (g)
NonDreaming     slow wave ("nondreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
Dreaming        paradoxical ("dreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
TotalSleep      total sleep, sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep (hrs/day)
LifeSpan        maximum life span (years)
Gestation       gestation time (days)
Predation       predation index (1-5)
1 = minimum (least likely to be preyed upon); 5 = maximum (most likely to be preyed upon)
Exposure        sleep exposure index (1-5)
1 = least exposed (e.g. animal sleeps in a well-protected den); 5 = most exposed
Danger      overall danger index (1-5) (based on the above two indices and other information)
1 = least danger (from other animals); 5 = most danger (from other animals)

The electronic data file was obtained from the Statlib database.

## Analysis

One can use multiple regression to predict the three sleep variables after suitably transforming the predictors and response. The response variable could be hours of sleep or the proportion of sleep spent dreaming. There are quite a few missing values. I have also used this data to illustrate regression trees for predicting duration of dream-sleep.
